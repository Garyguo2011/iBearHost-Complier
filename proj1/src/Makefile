# Top-level Makefile for Project 1.
# 
# Targets:
#   make [ default ]        Compiles sources in src directory
#   make check              Compiles sources and runs tests.  The parameter
#                            APYC indicates which compiler to run.
#   make clean              Removes unnecessary files, including those that
#                            are reproducible.
#   make depend	     Compute makefile dependencies and store
#                            in .depend.  Use this whenever you add a new
#                            source file or change an #include line.
#   make really-clean       Same as 'clean', also removes the file .depend.

# Here, the parser-sentinel file is a device that is used to group all
# the files generated by horn into one dependency so that the
# rebuilding instructions are executed only once.  Otherwise, an error
# in apyc.hn would cause repeated error messages as the command
# sequence was repeated for each one of them.  Each time we generate
# these files, we update the modify date on parser-sentinel.  The
# generated files in turn depend on parser-sentinel, and it depends on
# apyc.hn. So, whenever apyc.hn is changed, any compilation that
# depends on a generated file will cause horn to rebuild the generated
# files (ALL_GENERATED).
